        <h2>𝜗𝜚⋆ About Me 𝜗𝜚⋆</h2>
        <p>My name is Rianna, and I'm a very beginner-level developer. I'm interested in learning programming languages like CSS, JavaScript, HTML and Python because I want to learn to code apps and websites to showcase my interests and business ideas.</p>
        <p>Along with learning software development with <em>Power Learn Project Africa</em>, I've been self-training using free certificate courses offered by <em>freeCodeCamp</em>.</p>
        <p>I'm passionate about coding, editing, graphic design and audio production, all of which are in some way related.</p>
        <p>I had an interest in coding since I was in middle school, but after studying computer science in high school, I gained a more refined appreciation for the world of coding and the ways in which it improves our lives everyday.</p>
        <p>Now, I'm studying law in university and I'm excited to use my developing proficiency in coding to understand areas of the law like tech, cybersecurity and IP law.</p>

        <h2>𐙚⋆.˚ My Projects 𐙚⋆.˚</h2>
        <p>Here are some of my projects.</p>
        <h3>Basic Calculator Python Project</h3>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/RiannaOwino/SEE_Academy/blob/main/basic%20calculator.py">This</a> is a basic calculator python code I made which allows a user to enter two numbers and add, divide, subtract or multiply them. It involves a loop which prompts the user if they want to continue calculating or to end the operation.</p>
        <h3>Algorithmic Expressions Python Project</h3>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/RiannaOwino/SEE_Academy/blob/main/algorithmic%20expressions.py">This</a> is a showcase of an algorithmic expression that prompts the user for their age and uses if/elif statements to print a certain output dependent on the user's response.</p>
        <h3>Lists Python Project</h3>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/RiannaOwino/SEE_Academy/blob/main/list.py">This</a> project showcases the many python functions related to lists, such as appending, extending, and finding, adding or removing specific items through their index.
